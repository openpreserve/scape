Welcome to Axis2!

For information specific to this release, please check out the
release-notes.html file in this directory.

Full documentation can be found in the docs distribution of this release
(separate download), or on the main website at http://ws.apache.org/axis2.

____________________
Building from Source
====================

We use Maven 2 (http://maven.apache.org) to build, and you'll find a
pom.xml in each module, as well as at the top level.  Use "mvn install"
(or "mvn clean install" to clean up first) to build.

IMPORTANT: the *first* time you build a given version of Axis2, you will not
be able to do a regular "mvn install" from the top level - this is because
we have a couple of custom Maven plugins that (due to some dependency-
resolution issues in Maven) must be built and installed in your local
repository before a build will succeed.  This means you need to do one
of the following:

  1) Use ant (http://ant.apache.org) to build the first time.  There is
     a build.xml at the top level which automatically builds the plugins
     first and then runs a regular "mvn install".
     
  2) Manually "mvn install" both of the plugins in the following places:
     
     modules/tool/axis2-mar-maven-plugin
     modules/tool/axis2-aar-maven-plugin

___________________
Deploying
===================

To deploy a new Web service in Axis2 the following three steps must 
be performed:
  1) Create the Web service implementation class, supporting classes 
     and the services.xml file, 
  2) Archive the class files into a jar with the services.xml file in 
     the META-INF directory
  3) Drop the jar file to the $AXIS2_HOME/WEB-INF/services directory
     where $AXIS2_HOME represents the install directory of your Axis2 
     runtime. (In the case of a servelet container this would be the
     "axis2" directory inside "webapps".)

To verify the deployment please go to http://<yourip>:<port>/axis2/ and
follow the "Services" Link.

For more information please refer to the User's Guide.
