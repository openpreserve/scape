/** 
 * Service client wrapper classes
 * 
 * The purpose of these classes it to make it easier to write a remote
 * service client.
 * 
 * These classes are also intended to be able to cope with different versions
 * of the services. i.e. when a new version of the service interfaces comes 
 * out, these classes should be able to invoke both the old and the new versions,
 * promoting the older version so that client code can invoke it via the newer
 * interface.
 * 
 * 
 * This code has been stripped out of the servreg project for development.
 * It should be packaged separately in core anyway.
